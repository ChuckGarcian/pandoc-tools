Theis repo contains tools for compiling using Pandoc, most notably the makefile for compiling my UT-website.

The 'pandoc-markdown-css-theme' is by [jez](https://github.com/jez/pandoc-markdown-css-theme). However, I made some changes to the version in the repo to better suit my use case and workflow.
